### PYTHON
 - High-level
 - Interpreted - executes line by line
 - General purpose - backend, server scripting, data science
 - extensive libs
 - oop based

  c. data types
  d. Input and Output

  - control flows
   a. conditional statements
   b. loops

   - functions

   - virtual environment and packages

###  Python Operators

#### Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values

   - Arithmetic Operators : these perform common math operations +, - , * , / , % (modulus : returns the reminder from a division operation)

    - Assignment Operators : these operators assign values to variables = , += ( x += 3 : x = x + 3 ) , -= , *= , /= , %=

    - Comparison Operators : these operators are used to compare two values , the result is normally a boolean result True or False == , != , > , < , >= , <= ,

    - Logical Operators : these operators are used to chain / combine conditional statements / comparison operators a. and : return true if both statements are true b. or : returns true if one of the statements is true c. not : reverses the result , returns false if the result is true

    - Identity Operators : used to compare objects , not if they are equal , but if they are the same object. a. is : returns true if both variables are the same object b. is not : returns true if both variables are not the same objects

    - Membership Operators : used to test if a sequence is presented in an object a. in : returns true if a sequence with the value specified is present b. not in : returns true if a sequence with specified value is not present

    - Bitwise Operators : used to compare values in a binary nature a. and = & True = 1 False = 0 b. or = | c. not = ~ , !

### Data Types Operations

#### In built operations/methods that enable us to manipulate data Each Data type has its own variation for the built operations

- Numbers -> type casting , arithmetics operations
